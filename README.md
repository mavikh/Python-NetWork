Here I am practicing create socket to send and receive some data between server and client.
ss.py and cc.py are a server and client program where in server side a socket is bound to a port on the server(local host) and in client side a socket is connected to that server and some strings are transmited between them.
In serverT.py I create a server which is TCP-oriented and comunicates with telnet as a client and can recieve a stream bytes of data sent from telnet.
